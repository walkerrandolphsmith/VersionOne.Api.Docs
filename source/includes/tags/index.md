# ~/api/tags

First and foremost Tags are values that exist on most BaseAssets.  Tags exist only in the context of the Assets they are added to.  This means adding (and removing) tags for an Asset should be done via rest-1.v1/Data.

As of now Tags have been exposed on the following Assets via the AttributeDefinition TaggedWith

* Story
* Defect
* Test Set
* Task
* Test
* Portfolio Item
* Regression Test

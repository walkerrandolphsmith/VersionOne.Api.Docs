        <p>The API facilitates integration with external systems and allows direct queries to the Lifecycle data. This list contains some pointers for those getting started with the API.</p>
        <p>The API uses the database name of each asset. Here are a few common assets that are helpful to know when you create your queries:</p>
        <p>We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.</p>
        <h1 id="base-url">Base URL</h1>
        <p>Find your VersionOne url may look like this
          <a href="https://www7.v1host.com/V1Instance">https://www7.v1host.com/V1Instance</a>.</p>
        <p>In this case <code>www7.v1host.com</code> is your <code>host</code> and <code>V1Instance</code> is your <code>instance</code>. These will be used to build your base url that all requests to the API rely on.</p>

        <p>For this guide we will only show the VersionOne server accepting and responding with JSON.</p>
        <p>The <code>Content-Type</code> header tells the server what media type we are sending it in the request body.

        <h1 id="apis">APIs</h1>
        <h2 id="-meta-v1">~/meta.v1</h2>
        <p>The VersionOne Meta API provides read-only information about all the assets contained within VersionOne including their types, attributes, relationships, and the operations that they support. In addition, it allows you to discover information
          such as which attribute definitions are required, what content is valid for an attribute, which attributes belong to which asset types, and what custom fields an asset contains. For example, the Meta API will indicate that the Story asset type
          has an attribute definition called Estimate which is a Numeric attribute type and is not required.</p>
        <p>Each asset type contains a collection of attribute definitions, a collection of operations, and a number of useful attribute definitions for things like sorting. Each attribute definition describes the type of data it can contain as well as whether
          it is required, read only, and multi value. Each operation contains a reference to an attribute definition that can be used to determine whether the specific operation can be executed on a given asset.</p>
        <h2 id="-api-asset">~/api/asset</h2>
        <p>These samples will help guide the usage of the Bulk API endpoint. The VersionOne Rest API is our original and most general purpose endpoint for querying and manipulating of VersionOne assets. As with any endpoint or software tool in general, its
          scope of functionality can be robust but could have some limitations. One limitation with Rest API is that it cannot perform bulk updates without and is bound to a single operation at a time. </p>
        <p>For example, let&#39;s say I have 50,000 messages that I would like to delete. The traditional way to delete these assets would be create a script that reads the OIDS of 50,000 messages that you would like to delete and process them one at a time.
          Using the Rest-API or VersionOne .Net SDK, a deletion of this magnitude would take approximately 11-13 hours since we are force to repeat the following chunk of pseudo code.1</p>
        <span class="code-wrapper undefined "><pre class="highlight undefined "><code><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> oidList = getOidsToDelete(queryCriteria);
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">each</span> (OID x <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> oidList){
    deleteOid(x); <span class="hljs-comment">//Called 50,000 times!!!</span>
}</code></pre>
          <i class="fa fa-copy"></i>
        </span>
        <p>The complexity of the client code is very linear and network intensive since it requires 50K individual API calls so the average time in our testing has been 1 deletion per second using the SDK or API. The round trip time latency reduction gives
          the best case theoretical model would be a reduction of 35-40% time saved per transaction. We were able to witness an average throughput of 0.65 seconds/deletion or approximately 8.5 hours to process the 50K records given favorable network conditions
          and eliminating any of the code&#39;s bookkeeping required for track and report progress real-time.</p>
        <p>Using the Bulk Endpoint, the server is doing all of the work deleting assets closer to the database eliminating multiple calls to the API. This deletion is now a single POST to the bulk endpoint. The best-case 8.5 hour deletion time is now approaches
          2 hours.</p>
        <h2 id="-rest-1-v1-data">~/rest-1.v1/Data</h2>
        <p>This endpoint provides read, write, and update access to assets. This endpoint queries for simple or complex sets of information, updates information, and executes system-defined operations.</p>
        <h2 id="-rest-1-v1-hist">~/rest-1.v1/Hist</h2>
        <p>This endpoint provides read-only access to the history for assets by returning
          <a href="https://community.versionone.com/VersionOne_Connect/Developer_Library/Getting_Started/Platform_Concepts/Moment">moments</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="-query-v1">~/query.v1</h2>
        <p>This endpoint provides read-only access to assets. When HTTP round-trip time dominates the query response time, it can be useful to submit many queries in one HTTP transaction. This endpoint accepts an arbitrary number of independent queries.
          They are submitted to the retrieval subsystem in parallel. This endpoint also allows retrieval of arbitrarily nested master/detail and hierarchical relationships. For example, you can retrieve all the <code>Schedules</code> in a <code>Scope</code>,
          all the <code>Iterations</code> in the <code>Schedules</code>, and all the <code>Workitems</code> in the <code>Iterations</code>, all in one go.</p>
        <h2 id="-api-activitystream-asset-number-">~/api/activitystream/
          <asset-number>
        </h2>
        <p>This endpoint provides read-only access to the activity streams for assets and entities within VersionOne, however it is not guaranteed to contain every change to an asset. To get a full accounting of all changes, you must use the asset history.</p>
        <h2 id="-api-tags">~/api/tags</h2>
        <p>This endpoint provides read, write, and update access to tags. This endpoint queries for tags, creates tags, and updates tags.</p>
        <h2 id="-loc-2-v1">~/loc-2.v1</h2>
        <p>This endpoint provides localization and allows a client to retrieve the suggested localization of multiple strings. Often other VersionOne endpoints will return unlocalized strings such as suggested names or error messages. These unlocalized strings
          may be passed to loc-2.v1 which will attempt to translate the strings into locale specific strings returned as a JSON object with key-value pairs for each translation.</p>
        <p>In a case where a locale specific string could not be found, a series of fallbacks exist. For example if French-Canadian (fr-ca) does not have a localization entry for the string &quot;Story&quot;, the French locale (fr) will be searched, and
          then finally the English (en) locale will be searched. If no localization entry exists in any locale, the input string will be returned unchanged. To retrieve a localized string for a specific locale, set the &quot;Accept-Language&quot; HTTP
          Header in the request to a specific locale. For example to use French-Canadian set the header to &quot;fr-ca&quot;.</p>
        <h1 id="terminology">Terminology</h1>
        <h2 id="asset">Asset</h2>
        <p>A
          <strong>System Asset</strong> is a core business object in the VersionOne® Lifecycle model. Each asset represents the stories/backlog items, defects, sprints/iterations, and the members who use the system. The diagram below illustrates the relationship
          of these assets to one another and how they work together to help you manage your workflow.</p>
        <h2 id="asset-types">Asset Types</h2>
        <p>Asset types describe the &quot;classes&quot; of data available. Each asset type contains a collection of attribute definitions, a collection of operations, and a number of useful attribute definitions for things like sorting. Asset types form
          an inheritance hierarchy, such that each asset type inherits attribute definitions, operations, and rules from its parent asset type. Those asset types at the leaves of this hierarchy are concrete, whereas asset types with children asset types
          are abstract. Assets are all instances of concrete asset types. Asset types are identified by unique names.</p>
        <p>By way of example, Story and Defect are concrete asset types. On the other hand, Workitem is an abstract asset type, from which Story and Defect ultimately derive.</p>
        <p>Most asset types have the same name as found in the application user interface. A Defect in the user interface is also a Defect as an asset type. However, many of the most common asset types have a different name. </p>

        <h2 id="asset-states">Asset States</h2>
        <p>Asset states represent system-known life-cycle stage of an asset. The UI typically only show assets that are not &quot;Dead&quot;.</p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>

        </table>
        <aside class="notice"> In Lifecycle deleted assets are not permantely erased, but instead marked with an Asset State indicating they have no value to the system. If the asset is significant or has importance consider Closing it when it has reached maturity instead!
          </aside>
        <h2 id="attribute-definitions">Attribute Definitions</h2>
        <p>Attribute definitions describe the properties that &quot;make up&quot; each asset type. Each attribute definition describes the type of data it can contain as well as whether it is required, read only, multi-value, and many other qualities. Attribute
          definitions are identified by a name that is unique within its asset type. Attribute definitions are defined as either value types or relations to other assets. Further, relation attribute definitions can be either single-value or multi-value.</p>
        <p>For example, the <code>Estimate</code> attribute definition on the <code>Workitem</code> asset type is a scalar (specifically, a Number). On the other hand, the <code>Workitem</code> asset type&#39;s <code>Scope</code> attribute definition is
          a single-value relation (to a Scope asset). The reverse relation, <code>Workitems</code> on the <code>Scope</code> asset type, is a multi-value relation (to <code>Workitem</code> assets).</p>
        <h2 id="oid">OID</h2>
        <p>An OID is a unique system identifier that is not typically visible in the VersionOne user interface. OID Tokens are composed of the name of an asset type and an integer ID. For example, <code>Member:20</code> identifies a <code>Member</code> asset
          with ID of 20.</p>
        <p>This is not the same as the user visible Number attribute available on many (but not all) assets.</p>
        <h1 id="attribute-definition-syntax">Attribute Definition Syntax</h1>
        <p>An attribute is a single or multi-value property on an asset. For example a Story has an attribute called Reference which contains text, while the Owners attribute is a multi-value relationship which allows multiple people to own a single Workitem
          asset. Attributes can be very simple such as the previously mentioned Reference attribute or they may be complex including downcasting, filters, and aggregates.</p>
        <h2 id="projection">Projection</h2>
        <p>Often it is useful to follow a relationship from one asset through another to get another piece of information. For example if you wanted to know the name of a Category attribute on a Story asset you could ask for the attribute Category.Name on
          a Story and it would return the Name attribute of the StoryCategory which the Story asset relates to.</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://V1Host/V1Instance/rest-1.v1/Data/Story/1000/Category.Name">https://V1Host/V1Instance/rest-1.v1/Data/Story/1000/Category.Name</a>
        </p>
        <h2 id="downcast">Downcast</h2>
        <p>A Scope asset has a relation called Workitems which points to all the Workitem assets that belong to the given Scope. This includes Story, Defect, Task, and Test asset types. If you wish to only get Story assets you can use downcasting to filter
          to Workitem assets to a specific type. The following example would return only those Story assets that are in Scope with ID 0.</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://V1Host/V1Instance/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope/0/Workitems:Story">https://V1Host/V1Instance/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope/0/Workitems:Story</a>
        </p>
        <h2 id="filter">Filter</h2>
        <p>In another example you may wish to know all the Workitem assets in a given Scope that are owned by a specific Member. A filtered attribute would help solve this problem. You can use Workitems[Owners=&#39;Member:20&#39;] to return only those Workitem
          assets that are owned by Member with ID 20. An example URL would look like the following.</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://V1Host/V1Instance/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope/0/Workitems[Owners=&#39;Member:20">https://V1Host/V1Instance/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope/0/Workitems[Owners=&#39;Member:20</a>&#39;]</p>
        <h2 id="aggregation">Aggregation</h2>
        <p>Lets say you wanted to get the total number of Workitem assets in a particular Scope. You can use the aggregate portion of an attribute to count the number of Workitem assets. The following example would return the total number of Workitem assets
          that belong to Scope with ID 0.</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://V1Host/V1Instance/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope/0/Workitems.@Count">https://V1Host/V1Instance/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope/0/Workitems.@Count</a>
        </p>
        <h2 id="combination">Combination</h2>
        <p>To combine all of this into a more complex example, you may also wish to get the total Estimate for all Story assets that have an owner and are in a given Scope. Rather than getting all Workitem assets and programmatically sorting them into buckets,
          the API can help you. You can follow a relationship, filter the relationship, and then finally use an aggregate to return the final count all using a single attribute on a Scope asset.</p>
        <p>The corresponding attribute would be something like this: Workitems:Story[Owners.@Count!=&#39;0&#39;].Estimate.@Sum In this example the Scope.Workitems attribute will be downcast to only include Story assets, then filtered where the number of
          Owners is not zero. Once the filtered list is determined, then Estimate for those Story assets will be pulled and finally a single sum will be returned. This attribute will have a URL like the following.</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://V1Host/V1Instance/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope/0/Workitems:Story[Owners.@Count!=&#39;0&#39;].Estimate.@Sum">https://V1Host/V1Instance/rest-1.v1/Data/Scope/0/Workitems:Story[Owners.@Count!=&#39;0&#39;].Estimate.@Sum</a>
        </p>

        <p>Aliasing will allow you to assign the output of a bulk operation to a reference. One of the advantages of this feature is that it will allow users to make a reference to previously created assets in a later part of the payload. For example, I
          want to create a brand new scope and use this scope but reference it later on in the payload.</p>
        <p>Create a new scope and then create a new story whose scope is the newly created scope.</p>

                not a page count. The page size is the maximum number of items to return on a page. For example if you have 100 assets and want to see the first 10, you would use a page start of 0, and a page size of 10. To retrieve the second page simply
                ask for a page start of 10 with a page size of 10, and so on.</td>

        <p>The Asset node has an <code>href</code> attribute containing the URL path used to retrieve this asset. The asset node has an <code>id</code> attribute with the

        <h3 id="request-body">Request Body</h3>
        <p>Both creating and updating assets via rest-1.v1 has a POST body structured with a collection of attributes. When creating, it can contain Attributes that will exist on the new asset, and when updating it can contain Attributes that will modify
          an existing Asset.</p>
        <p>The keys are valid Attribute names for a given Asset. The value of each key is valid based on the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Scalars</em>: like <code>Name</code> take a string value.</p>

          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Single-value relation</em>: like <code>Scope</code> takes an OidToken.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Multi-value relations</em>: like <code>ChangeSets</code> take an array. Each element of the array specifies an asset to add or remove from the relation and have the shape:

        <h3 id="http-request">HTTP Request</h3>
        <p><code>POST http://V1Host/V1Instance/rest-1.v1/Data/&lt;AssetType&gt;/&lt;Oid&gt;</code></p>
        <h1 id="-rest-1-v1-hist">~/rest-1.v1/Hist</h1>
        <p>VersionOne maintains history as data changes. Every change to every asset is journaled within the system, and assigned a chronologically-increasing integer called a moment. A past version of an asset is uniquely identified by its asset type, ID,
          and Moment. A past version of a relation attribute will refer to the past version of its target asset.</p>
        <p>For example, <code>Member:20:563</code> identifies the <code>Member</code> asset with ID of 20, as it was at the time of moment 563.</p>
        <p>History is made up of events that occur at specific times or moments. Consider running into an old friend at exactly 9:32 PM. At that exact moment an event occured, you and an old friend met. In the VersionOne system every change to every asset
          is an event, which causes a specific moment to be recorded in the VersionOne history.</p>
        <p>For example changing a <code>Story</code> asset then changing a <code>Scope</code> asset would occur at two different times or moments. When a specific asset changes its own individual history is marked as changing as part of that moment. So for
          example, you create a brand new <code>Story</code> asset, it may get marked with moment number 203. If you then update the <code>Story To Do</code> attribute, the <code>Story</code> will be marked as having changed at moment number 204. If someone
          else then updates a <code>Member</code> Name attribute, the <code>Member</code> will be marked with moment number 205. Moment numbers are sequential, but are mantained globally for the entire VersionOne system. The next global change in the
          system will be marked with moment 206.</p>
        <p>In the above example the <code>Story</code> history will have been marked with two distinct moment numbers. The first being moment number 203, the moment the asset was created and the second being when the <code>To Do</code> attribute was changed,
          at moment number 204. As mentioned above moment numbers are not sequential for a specific asset, they are sequential for the entire VersionOne system. Between the time you created the <code>Story</code> asset and the time you changed its <code>To Do</code>          attribute, another user may have changed an entirely different asset in the VersionOne system, thus making a gap in between your <code>Story</code> asset&#39;s moments.</p>

        <p>Read only api that allows retrieval of arbitrarily nested master/detail and hierarchical relationships. (For example, you can retrieve all the <code>Schedules</code> in a <code>Scope</code>, all the <code>Iterations</code> in the <code>Schedules</code>,
